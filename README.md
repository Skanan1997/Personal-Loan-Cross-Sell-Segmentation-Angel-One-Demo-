# Personal-Loan-Cross-Sell-Segmentation-Angel-One-Demo-
Project Title: Personal Loan Cross-Sell Segmentation Dashboard | Angel One (DEMO)


# 📊 Project Overview:

In this project, I designed and built a Power BI dashboard to support the cross-selling of personal loan products at Angel One, a fintech company primarily offering stock broking services and recently expanding into financial products such as personal loans, insurance, FDs, MFs, and more.

The goal was to leverage customer segmentation to identify potential clients for personal loan products based on demographics, product usage, and credit score analysis.

# 📈 Key Business Problem:

How can Angel One efficiently segment its existing customer base to identify those who are most likely to take a personal loan, thereby maximizing cross-sell opportunities?

# ⚖️ Business Objectives:

Segment customers by credit score and age to identify personal loan prospects.

Distinguish new clients from existing ones.

Analyze product usage patterns to identify gaps.

Evaluate regional distribution of non-loan users to optimize campaigns.

# ⚙️ Tools & Technologies:

Power BI

Power Query (M)

DAX

Microsoft Excel (Data simulation)

SQL (Initial querying)

# 📊 Dataset Description:

Synthetic dataset of 10,000 Angel One clients with the following attributes:

Customer ID, Age, Gender, Region

Products Used (Multi-valued string column)

Credit Score (including logic to assign -1 to underage or first-time clients)

Account Status (Active/Inactive)

Personal Loan Status (Derived column)

Interest Rate Range (Based on credit score groupings)

# 📅 Key KPIs & Visuals in Dashboard:

Total Clients, Active Clients, New to Loan Product, Loans Taken (Cards)

Clients by Credit Score & Interest Rate (Bar Chart)

Clients by Age Group (Donut Chart)

Loan Usage by Product (Bar Chart)

Active Clients Without Loans by Region (Treemap)

New Clients by Age Group (Matrix Table)

Slicer Filters: Age Group, Region, Credit Score, Interest Rate, Gender

# 🚀 Outcome & Insights:

Identified that a majority of new clients have not availed loan products.

Mapped credit scores to interest rate buckets for targeted messaging.

Isolated regions and age segments with untapped loan potential.

# 🎓 Learnings:

Hands-on experience with dynamic DAX measures and calculated columns.

Deepened understanding of customer segmentation in fintech.

Built end-to-end data story from raw data to executive dashboard.
